# Mutual Fund Analytics Platform 📈
### End-to-End Data Engineering & ETL Pipeline — Bluestock Capstone Project

Welcome to the **Mutual Fund Analytics Platform** Capstone Project repository, developed as part of the Bluestock Fintech Internship program. 

This repository leverages a clean **Monorepo Structure** to organize the end-to-end development of a financial analytics platform that ingests, cleans, stores, analyzes, and visualizes Indian Mutual Fund datasets.

## 🚀 Progressive Project Roadmap

### 📅 [Day 1: Project Setup + Data Ingestion](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%201/README.md)
*   **ETL Bootstrap Ingestion:** Completed local python pipeline in `day 1/data_ingestion.py` that auto-generates raw dataset structures and audits file metrics.
*   **Live NAV Fetcher:** Real-time JSON parser in `day 1/live_nav_fetch.py` scraping historical NAVs for 6 core mutual fund schemes directly from the public AMFI REST API (`mfapi.in`).
*   **Quality Reports:** Comprehensive data quality and referential integrity audit generated in `day 1/reports/day1_data_quality_summary.md`.

### 📅 [Day 2: Data Cleaning + SQLite DB Design](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%202/data_dictionary.md)
*   **Robust Data Cleaning:** Implemented parsing, deduplication, anomaly boundaries, and daily continuous **forward-filling** for holiday/weekend NAV tracking in `day 2/data_cleaning.py`.
*   **Dimensional Star Schema:** Designed a normalized relational model in `day 2/schema.sql` spanning 2 dimension tables (`dim_fund`, `dim_date`) and 6 fact tables (`fact_nav`, `fact_transactions`, etc.).
*   **SQL Analytics:** Drafted 10 high-value business queries in `day 2/queries.sql` analyzing AUM trends, monthly average NAVs, YoY growth, and investor demographic cash flows.

### 📅 [Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%203/EDA_Analysis.ipynb)
*   **Table Schema Ingestion**: Built connection handlers to load facts and dimensions dynamically into Pandas dataframes.
*   **10 Key Analytical Dashboards**: Generated 15 interactive charts (Plotly/Seaborn) analyzing historical NAVs, AUM growth, demographics, geographic distributions, folio growth, and correlation metrics.
*   **Insight Discovery**: Documented 10 key findings regarding folio-AUM elasticity, SIP ticket size distribution, and demographic concentrations.

### 📅 [Day 4: Mutual Fund Performance Analytics & Scorecard](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%204/README.md)
*   **Quantitative Computations**: Coded multi-period CAGR calculations (1yr, 3yr, and 4.4yr proxies) and aligned NAV return series against Nifty 100 benchmark calendars.
*   **Risk-Adjusted Efficiency**: Computed annualized Sharpe and Sortino Ratios using excess returns relative to a 6.5% risk-free rate and downside deviation.
*   **OLS Benchmark Regressions**: Conducted regressions vs. Nifty 100, extracting Alpha (active outperformance), Beta (volatility factor), R-squared, and regression p-value significance.
*   **Composite Scoring**: Created a 0-100 scale investment ranking scorecard weighting 3yr CAGR (30%), Sharpe (25%), Alpha (20%), Expense Ratio (15%), and Max Drawdown (10%), with Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund scoring highest (85.90).

### 📅 [Day 5: Interactive BI Dashboard & Web Deployment](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%205/README.md)
*   **Web Dashboard App**: Developed a 5-page Streamlit application reflecting Power BI analytics layout, matching Bluestock Fintech brand colors and typography.
*   **Star Schema Connection**: Integrated SQLite star schema to power real-time visualizations (AUM growth, risk-return scatters, geo-demographic transactions, and benchmark comparisons).
*   **Automated Exports**: Wrote Playwright-based browser automation to render and capture all dashboard views and compile a unified `Dashboard.pdf` report.

### 📅 [Day 6: Advanced Analytics & Risk Metrics](file:///c:/Users/jibum/OneDrive/Desktop/Bluestock%20Internship/day%206/README.md)
*   **Risk Metrics Evaluation:** Computed 95% Historical VaR and 95% CVaR for all 40 schemes, exporting results to `var_cvar_report.csv`. Aligned returns with Nifty 100 calendar to prevent weekend distortions.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Plotted 90-day annualized rolling Sharpe ratios for 5 major schemes over a 4.4-year timeline, outputting `rolling_sharpe_chart.png`.
*   **Investor Cohorts:** Categorized investor transactions by first transaction year, computing average SIP amounts, gross/net invested capital, and top fund preference.
*   **Operational Health:** Evaluated gaps between transaction dates for investors with 6+ SIPs, flagging 97.8% as "at-risk" due to average transaction gaps exceeding 35 days.
*   **Sector Concentration:** Calculated Sector HHI across all equity portfolios. Axis Bluechip was identified as the most concentrated (HHI: 2,967.69) and UTI Mid Cap as the most diversified (HHI: 1,240.20).
*   **Standalone Recommendation System:** Built `recommender.py` to recommend the top 3 mutual funds matching user risk appetites (`Low` / `Moderate` / `High`), sorted by Sharpe ratio.
